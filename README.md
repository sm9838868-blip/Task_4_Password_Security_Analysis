📌 Overview
This repository contains my submission for Task 4 of the Cyber Security Internship, which focuses on understanding password security, common password attack techniques, and modern authentication defenses.
The objective of this task is to analyze how passwords are stored, why weak passwords fail, and how strong authentication mechanisms such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) improve security.

🎯 Objectives of the Task
Understand how passwords are stored using hashing
Learn the difference between hashing and encryption
Identify common hashing algorithms
Study password attack techniques
Analyze reasons for weak password failures
Understand the importance of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Provide recommendations for strong authentication

🧠 Concepts Covered
Hashing vs Encryption
Hashing Algorithms: MD5, SHA-1, bcrypt
Password Hash Generation (conceptual)
Dictionary Attacks
Brute-Force Attacks
Weak Password Analysis
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Best Practices for Strong Passwords

🛠 Tools & Resources Studied
Hashcat (conceptual understanding)
John the Ripper (conceptual understanding)
Online Hash Generators (for learning purposes)
